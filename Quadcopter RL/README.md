# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller :



#### Target :
Training an RL agent(quadcopter controller) to learn to fly & perform the defined tasks in direction to maximise reward.

#### Algorithm Class :
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)                                                                                                 
#### Task :
Defined a takeoff task where the quadcopter aims to attain a height of 100.
