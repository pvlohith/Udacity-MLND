Projects as a part of Machine learning nanodegree program at Udacity

Dog breed Classifer: • Predicts the dog breed out of 135 breeds if the image is of a dog, else if the image is of a human, the algorithm after identifying it as a human predicts the resembling dog breed.
• Implemented a simple CNN from scratch to form a baseline model. 
• Used VGG16 and Resnet50 architectures  via transfer learning to build better performing models. Achieved an accuracy score of 80% with Resnet50.
